                <p>CADDi developed and provided the “Manufacturing AI Data Platform CADDi,” which analyzes and
                    correlates
                    all data in the engineering and supply chain of the manufacturing industry and extracts insights to
                    advance all production activities and decision-making.</p>
                <p>In June 2022, they released CADDi Drawer, a cloud service for manufacturing data utilization, to
                    support
                    the capitalization of critical data in the manufacturing industry. In the future, CADDi plans to
                    offer a variety
                    of applications on the platform, including CADDi Quote, a manufacturing AI quotation cloud that
                    facilitates
                    capitalization of supply chain data. CADDi has raised 21.73 billion yen in total funding and has

                                        At CADDi, engineers

                            <p><strong>Significant Challenges</strong></p>
                            <p>Despite being a major global industry, manufacturing has seen little innovation in the
                                procurement
                                domain. Working at CADDi means tackling these challenges head-on and becoming a creator
                                of global
                                standards.</p>

                            <p><strong>Challenge the Real World</strong></p>
                            <p>Manufacturing industry challenges are complex, involving real-world operations. At CADDi,
                                engineers

                                digital ones but also
                                developing new methods alongside the field.</p>

                            <p>In CADDi’s development environment, building a global supply chain is crucial. Engineers
                                from diverse
                                countries come together, conversing in both Japanese and English. They exchange ideas on
                                an equal
                                footing, always pursuing the core essence.</p>

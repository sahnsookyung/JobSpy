When mounted on the fingertip of a robot hand, etc., the tactile sense (distribution of force, slip, etc.) can be perceived, enabling robots to be controlled as if a person were handling an object using a \"palm\" sensation. The feature of this sensor is its high functionality (multi-modality, high-resolution), yet it is highly practical and economical. Although it is called a \"tactile\" sensor, it is a completely new concept of \"opto-tactile\" sensor that also has a modality for viewing the object to be grasped (vision), and has unlimited application possibilities in addition to process automation in combination with robots.\n\n###

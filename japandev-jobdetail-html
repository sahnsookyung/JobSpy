                    <p><strong>Recruitment Background</strong></p>
                    <p>CADDi is on a mission to "Unleash the potential of manufacturing."<br>
                        Launched in 2022, "CADDi DRAWER" is a groundbreaking product that uses technologies such as
                        machine learning to structure and link critical design data, considered vital in the
                        manufacturing sector. This innovation transforms this data into valuable informational assets.
                        Already, we have received significant adoption from leading domestic manufacturing companies and
                        machining firms, growing at a pace far exceeding T2D3. In 2023, we expanded our sales efforts to
                        international markets, including the United States, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Our vision for the future is to replicate and consolidate manufacturing expertise through
                        technology, extending beyond blueprints to achieve holistic optimization across departments and
                        companies. We aspire to transform our customers' workstyles and cultures, ultimately driving a
                        revolution in the entire manufacturing industry.<br>
                        Over the next few years, we plan to globally deploy numerous new applications on our platform.
                        Achieving this scale and speed of business expansion requires a foundational platform, robust
                        infrastructure, and unparalleled reliability to support all these applications.</p>
                    <p>The CADDi Core Division is at the heart of ensuring that the products we continuously create
                        deliver value globally, quickly and reliably. We are looking for an Engineering Manager to
                        maximize the productivity of the development organization within the CADDi Core Division and
                        lead its business growth.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>What is an Engineering Manager at CADDi?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your mission is to maximize the results of the departments and groups you oversee.</li>
                        <li>Setting OKRs to chart the course forward and perform necessary management tasks by working
                            backward from our desired future state.</li>
                        <li>The role of an EM is not rigidly defined; we believe the approach to achieving results
                            should align with each individual's strengths. For example, some excel at empowering others
                            to drive outcomes, while others lead design and policy decisions directly on the ground. The
                            balance between technology management, project management, product management, and people
                            management also varies depending on each EM's assigned domain and key focus areas.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This recruitment position is primarily for leading a team involved in application development and
                        platform development. The team is composed of members from multiple countries and operates as a
                        global team.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Setting and managing team goals aligned with business strategy and product vision.</li>
                        <li>Developing team members through 1-on-1 meetings, performance evaluations, and feedback
                            sessions.</li>
                        <li>Driving recruitment initiatives and external communications to strengthen our engineering
                            brand.</li>
                        <li>Designing organizational structures optimized for scaling the product and business.</li>
                        <li>Planning and implementing effective information-sharing processes to enhance productivity in
                            a bilingual (Japanese and English) environment.</li>
                        <li>Identifying issues, proposing initiatives, and executing measures aimed at maximizing the
                            value and effectiveness of the engineering organization.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>About the position</strong></p>
                    <p>You will be responsible for managing platform service development within the CADDi Core Division,
                        which oversees the common infrastructure (including goal setting for your assigned domain and
                        various management activities to achieve those goals).</p>
                    <p>The mission of the CADDi Core Division is to develop and expand platform services that bear
                        responsibility for solving common technical challenges across applications, thereby driving the
                        overall business growth of CADDi through the power of its technological foundation.</p>
                    <p>※ The following tasks are not handled by a single manager at once; responsibilities are divided
                        based on assigned areas, current priorities, and individual strengths and preferences.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Promoting Platform Servitization: Planning, development, and operational policy management
                            for foundational services independent of business logic</li>
                        <li>Advancing Platform Engineering: Developing and providing platforms and tools to enhance
                            company-wide developer experience (DX)</li>
                        <li>Close collaboration with EMs and Product Managers in application development organizations
                        </li>
                        <li>People Management for Development Teams: Recruitment, Development, Evaluation,
                            Organizational Design, etc.</li>
                        <li>Formulation and Execution of Technical Strategy: Selecting appropriate technologies and
                            optimizing infrastructure costs based on business phase and ROI</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples of areas of responsibility</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>File Platform: Responsible for unifying file upload and download functionality required by
                            multiple applications.</li>
                        <li>Workflow Engine: Responsible for providing the execution foundation to perform large-scale
                            batch processing in a defined sequence.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, develops and provides foundational services to resolve technical challenges
                            within applications.</li>
                        <li>If your interests or strengths lie closer to the application layer, you may also be assigned
                            to manage the Reliability domain (which includes SRE, QA, and Product Security) within the
                            application development organization.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Around 30% of our development team members come from various international backgrounds, including
                        Asia, Europe, and North America. To build a thriving multicultural environment, some teams
                        communicate primarily in English, and critical meetings are held bilingually in both Japanese
                        and English.</p>
                    <p>As a manager, you’ll be responsible for leading diverse, multinational teams. Depending on your
                        experience and organizational needs, you may manage one or multiple teams. The exact team(s)
                        you’ll oversee will be decided based on your expertise and preferences discussed during
                        interviews and will be presented during the offer stage.</p>
                    <p>Internal communication within teams is primarily in English, whereas communication across teams
                        involves a mix of Japanese and English, but a high level of Japanese proficiency isn't
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>This role provides you with opportunities to tackle challenging problems alongside passionate
                        colleagues, contribute to a product that’s reshaping industry structures and creating social
                        impact, participate in scaling a global product and international engineering organization, and
                        experience significant professional growth by working closely with experienced leaders,
                        including former CTOs of publicly listed SaaS companies.</p>
                    <p>※ Based on your experience and preferences, you will be expected to manage either a single team
                        or multiple teams immediately upon joining.</p>
                    <p>※ Alternatively, you may start by actively contributing hands-on for several months to deepen
                        your technical understanding, build relationships with stakeholders, and gradually transition
                        into management duties.</p>
                    <p>※ Regarding your initial responsibilities:<br>
                        We will propose your assigned area during the offer discussion, referencing the preferences and
                        strengths discussed during the casual meeting and interviews.<br>
                        We also look forward to discussing the details of each organization during the casual meeting.

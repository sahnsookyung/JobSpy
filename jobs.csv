==============================================

***業務概要***

Axelspace では、自社で設計・製造し、ロケット事業者に委託して打ち上げた人工衛星を、自社で開発した衛星運用システムを使って運用しています。 Axelspace の衛星システム自動化グループは ""Operate to automate"", ""Automate all"" をモットーとして、衛星運用システムの自動化を進めています。衛星の運用全体に責任を持ち、日常的な運用をこなしつつ既存ミッションにおける、まだ十分に自動化されていない項目の自動化、および新規ミッションにおける要件分析と新規機能の開発を継続的に進めています。

衛星運用エンジニアは、上記自動化プロセスの入口の役割を担います。衛星運用で発生した各種テレメトリを分析して問題点を見つけ、DevOpsチームや衛星バス開発チームと協力してその問題点の原因を特定します。また、問題点に対する一時対応を実施するためのコマンドの実行、および運用を効率化するための運用ツール、監視ツールの開発が含まれます。

***職務内容***

衛星システム自動化グループの一員として、以下、および、その他指示された業務を、グループの他のメンバーと協力して実施します。

* 衛星の非定常状態におけるテレメトリの分析と問題の特定。および問題を解決するための自動化プランをDevOpsチームや衛星バス開発チームと策定する。
* 衛星バスの仕様の把握と管制のためのコマンドの実行。
* 衛星の監視計画の設計と実装。
* コマンディングを効率化するためのツールの開発

***必要なスキル・経験***

* システムに搭載された複数のセンサーなどから取得したログ(電流・電圧・回転数・シグナル強度・温度・画像・設定値など)からシステム上で起こっている問題の原因を特定するデータ分析力。
* Pythonを利用したソフトウェア開発経験。
* 英会話による技術的コミュニケーションができること。(TOEICスコア700相当以上)
  + 英語の技術文書を読解・作成、テキストチャットによるコミュニケーション。
  + 英語によるコミュニケーションの改善を継続しつづけられる姿勢。

***歓迎条件***

* ビジネスレベルの英語力。

* 地上局運用、テレコマ運用等、人工衛星に関わる経験、知識、資格。
* 人工衛星および人工衛星向けコンポーネントの設計・開発経験。

***チームからのメッセージ***

Axelspace の衛星運用チームは、現在 5 機の衛星からなるコンステレーションを運用しています。  
2018 年末に最初の１機 GRUS-1A を打ち上げ運用を開始し、運用システムの改善を重ねて 2021年３月に４機 GRUS-1BCDE の同時打ち上げに対する初期運用を完了し、定常運用を行っています。  
最初の１機の時点では、ほぼ存在しない状態であった運用システムを、ソフトウェア開発チーム自身が運用も行う DevOps のスタイルで行うことで、開発、拡張してきました。  
CI/CD を活用し日常的に運用ソフトウェアのデプロイを行っており、GRUS-1BCDE の打ち上げに際しても、ごく簡単なものですが、first pass から 2nd pass までの間に運用システムを改変してデプロイしています。これは、運用システムおよび衛星を含むシステム全体のアーキテクチャが、改変に対して頑強となるよう設計されていること、また、日常的に小さな更新を行うことで、更新そのもの、および、更新の検証、問題があった場合の検出、ロールバック等が安定して実現できる環境が構築されていることから実現できたことだと考えています。  
これらは、現代的なソフトウェア開発では一定程度広く行われていることだと思いますが、アクセルスペースの衛星運用チームでは、こういった手法をより進化させて、みなさんと一緒に、スケールする衛星サービスを作って行きたいと思います。

***About the Role***

At Axelspace, we design and manufacture our own satellites, launch them through contracted rocket operators, and operate them using a proprietary satellite operation system developed in-house. The Satellite System Automation Group at Axelspace follows the mottos “Operate to automate” and “Automate all”, striving to enhance the automation of satellite operations. This group is responsible for the entire satellite operation process, handling daily operations while continuously automating aspects of existing missions that are not yet fully automated and analyzing requirements and developing new functionalities for upcoming missions.

Satellite operations engineers serve as the entry point for this automation process. They analyze various telemetry data generated during satellite operations to identify issues and work closely with the DevOps team and the satellite bus development team to determine their root causes. Additionally, they execute commands for temporary issue responses and develop operational and monitoring tools to improve efficiency.

***Job Responsibilities***

As a member of the Satellite System Automation Group, you will collaborate with other team members to perform the following tasks, along with any other assigned duties:

* Analyze telemetry data during abnormal satellite conditions and identify issues, then formulate automation plans with the DevOps team and satellite bus development team to resolve them.
* Understand satellite bus specifications and execute temporary response commands.
* Design and implement satellite monitoring plans.
* Develop tools to optimize commanding processes.

***Mandatory Requirements***

* Data analysis skills to identify the causes of issues occurring in the system using logs obtained from multiple onboard sensors (e.g., current, voltage, rotation speed, signal strength, temperature, images, and configuration values).
* Software development experience using Python.
* Ability to engage in basic technical communication in spoken Japanese (equivalent to JLPT N3 or higher).
* Ability to read, write, and communicate via text chat in Japanese for technical documentation.
* Willingness to continuously improve Japanese communication skills.

***Favorable Skill set / Experiences***

* Business-level Japanese proficiency.
* Experience developing front-end applications using modern frameworks such as TypeScript, Nuxt, Vue.js, or React.
* Experience, knowledge, or certifications related to satellite operations, such as ground station operations or telemetry and command operations.
* Experience in designing and developing satellites or satellite components.

***Message from the Team***

Axelspace's satellite operation team is currently operating a constellation of five satellites.  
Operation of the constellation started at the end of 2018 with the launch of GRUS-1A. While operating GRUS-1A we concurrently improved the system in preparation for the launch of the next four satellites, GRUS-1BCDE. We successfully completed initial operation of those satellites and are now carrying out nominal operation for all five.  
By employing a DevOps style of combined development and operation, our team was able to develop and expand our operation system from its almost nonexistent beginnings at the launch of GRUS-1A to an automated system that can operate a constellation of many satellites.  
We use CI and CD for routine software deployments. Because of the rapid deployments this allows, after we discovered a small bug in the operation system during the first communications pass after the launch of GRUS-1BCDE, we were able to deploy a fix in time for the second pass.  
The architecture of the complete system including the operation system and the satellites is designed with maintainability in mind. Additionally, by making frequent small changes on a routine basis instead of having large releases containing multiple features, we simplify troubleshooting after deployment. It is this approach that prepared us to act quickly and fix the problem we found during initial operation of GRUS-1BCDE.  
These methods are used throughout the software industry. Our goal, as Axelspace's satellite operation team, is to further refine and adapt these methods and work together to make a scalable automated satellite service.

*チームからのメッセージ*

Axelspace の衛星運用チームは、2025年7月現在 5機の衛星からなるコンステレーションを運用しています。  
2018 年末に最初の1機 GRUS-1A を打ち上げ運用を開始し、運用システムの改善を重ねて 2021年3月に4機 GRUS-1BCDE の同時打ち上げに対する初期運用を完了し、定常運用を行っています。  
最初の１機の時点では、ほぼ存在しない状態であった運用システムを、ソフトウェア開発チーム自身が運用も行うスタイルを採用することで、開発、拡張してきました。  
現在ではCI/CD環境の整備を行い日常的に運用ソフトウェアのデプロイを行っており、GRUS-1BCDE の打ち上げに際しても、ごく簡単なものですが、first pass から 2nd pass までの間に運用システムを改変してデプロイしています。これは、運用システムおよび衛星を含むシステム全体のアーキテクチャが、改変に対して頑強となるよう設計されていること、また、日常的に小さな更新を行うことで、更新そのもの、および、更新の検証、問題があった場合の検出、ロールバック等が安定して実現できる環境が構築されています。  
これらは、現代的なソフトウェア開発では一定程度広く行われていることだと思いますが、アクセルスペースの衛星運用チームでは、こういった手法をより進化させていき、みなさんと一緒に、スケールする衛星サービスを作って行きたいと思います。

As of July 2025, Axelspace’s satellite operations team manages a constellation of five satellites. We began operations at the end of 2018 with the launch of GRUS‑1A. Through continuous improvement of our operational software, we supported the simultaneous launch and initial operation of GRUS‑1BCDE in March 2021, and have since conducted routine operations for all five satellites.

Initially, our operations system was almost nonexistent, so we adopted a DevOps approach—our development team also runs the system. Today, we maintain a CI/CD environment that enables routine deployments of operational software. For example, after discovering a minor bug during the first communications pass of GRUS‑1BCDE, we deployed a fix in time for the second pass. Our end‑to‑end architecture is designed for resilience to changes, and by releasing small, frequent updates, we simplify validation, troubleshooting, and rollback. We aim to further refine these practices and, together with you, build a scalable, fully automated satellite service.

*チームからのメッセージ*

Axelspace の衛星運用チームは、2025年7月現在 5機の衛星からなるコンステレーションを運用しています。  
2018 年末に最初の1機 GRUS-1A を打ち上げ運用を開始し、運用システムの改善を重ねて 2021年3月に4機 GRUS-1BCDE の同時打ち上げに対する初期運用を完了し、定常運用を行っています。  
最初の１機の時点では、ほぼ存在しない状態であった運用システムを、ソフトウェア開発チーム自身が運用も行うスタイルを採用することで、開発、拡張してきました。  
現在ではCI/CD環境の整備を行い日常的に運用ソフトウェアのデプロイを行っており、GRUS-1BCDE の打ち上げに際しても、ごく簡単なものですが、first pass から 2nd pass までの間に運用システムを改変してデプロイしています。これは、運用システムおよび衛星を含むシステム全体のアーキテクチャが、改変に対して頑強となるよう設計されていること、また、日常的に小さな更新を行うことで、更新そのもの、および、更新の検証、問題があった場合の検出、ロールバック等が安定して実現できる環境が構築されています。  
これらは、現代的なソフトウェア開発では一定程度広く行われていることだと思いますが、アクセルスペースの衛星運用チームでは、こういった手法をより進化させていき、みなさんと一緒に、スケールする衛星サービスを作って行きたいと思います。

As of July 2025, Axelspace’s satellite operations team manages a constellation of five satellites. We began operations at the end of 2018 with the launch of GRUS‑1A. Through continuous improvement of our operational software, we supported the simultaneous launch and initial operation of GRUS‑1BCDE in March 2021, and have since conducted routine operations for all five satellites.

Initially, our operations system was almost nonexistent, so we adopted a DevOps approach—our development team also runs the system. Today, we maintain a CI/CD environment that enables routine deployments of operational software. For example, after discovering a minor bug during the first communications pass of GRUS‑1BCDE, we deployed a fix in time for the second pass. Our end‑to‑end architecture is designed for resilience to changes, and by releasing small, frequent updates, we simplify validation, troubleshooting, and rollback. We aim to further refine these practices and, together with you, build a scalable, fully automated satellite service.

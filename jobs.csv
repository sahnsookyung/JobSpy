**Our team**

All technology is written and maintained by a multi-discipline engineering team of around 800 people. This includes server-side, client-side and mobile engineers working closely with UX experts, copywriters and designers. We follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs and Asana to specify and manage work; Github and CircleCI as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.  Kraken is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills. Some of our coding conventions are open-source .

**Our technology**

On the server-side, we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django, Django-REST-framework and GraphQL (Graphene). We use AWS heavily as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, Django, ELB health checks and continuous delivery.

**What you'll do**

* We have lots of difficult 
  *design challenges*
   to solve. The Japanese energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential
* We have difficult 
  *technical problems*
   to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption
* There's a great opportunity for disruption in the Japanese energy market. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
* You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future

**What you'll have**

* We're looking for someone with a general interest in technology and problem-solving; someone diligent and thoughtful. It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order):
* Python
* Django (or equiv. web framework)
* Domain modelling
* HTTP and REST APIs
* Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
* Celery and async processing
* Postgres

Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:

* AWS
* Terraform, Packer, Consul
* Ability to speak Japanese would be a plus

**What you'll love about us**

* **Our company culture -**
  we won best company to work for in 2019 and our CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people
* **Flexible working environment -**
  genuine work life balance here, we are in the top 5 companies in the UK, we treat you as a human, and do our best to make work and life merge smoothly together
* **Relaxation**
  - we don’t count your holidays here, we work hard, and so we know you need to play hard as well (within reason of course)
* **Equity Options Scheme -**
  you own your own part of the business, share options in the whole Octopus Energy Group so we all work together towards success
* **Office culture -**
  have a certain tech requirement? We’ll do our best to get it. Our offices are also stocked with fruit, breakfast, great coffee and soft drinks. Weekly on a Friday we all get together (this happens virtually too) for company updates and drinks - we call it Family Dinner
* **Your development is important -**
  we support and help with development including internal and external courses, learning, study support etc, all bespoke to you

Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.
  
  
In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.
  
  
**About The Role**
The Notion sales organization has a strong Product Led Growth lean, with many customers entering our funnel through our self-service motion before our product grows toward being a wall-to-wall solution. As we grow, more and more prospects are investigating how Notion can integrate with their existing tech stack, replace existing solutions, or be deployed in large or phased implementation to support desired business goals. As an early member of the Solutions Engineering team, you will:
  
  

* Partner with members of the sales org on customer engagements with prospective and existing customers
* Respond to advanced product and technical questions, RFPs, and security questionnaires in a precise and timely manner
* Provide thoughtful technical guidance to customers throughout the sales process, with a focus on quickly enabling customers to successfully deploy and integrate Notion
* Showcase custom solutions with Notion based on deep understanding of Notion’s ability to support customer workflows and integrated applications as part of the pre-sales process
* Curate structured product feedback to enable the Product and Engineering teams to enhance and refine Notion to solve customer needs
* Work with marketing to refine our technical narrative for the product, including blog posts, webinars, and customer-facing marketing collateral
* Educate the sales org on the product, upcoming releases, competitive analysis, and topical information about typical customer environments and third party applications
* Document technical considerations and contribute to internal knowledge bases as a resource for other teams, customers, and partners

**What You'll Achieve**

* Serve as the customer's technical advisor: You'll help customers craft Notion to serve their specific business needs and explore new workflows and use cases.
* Meaningfully shape our future product and messaging: As you engage with customers, you'll gain insights to help us serve them better — and work with product to inform what we do next.
* Help build the foundations of Solutions Engineering at Notion - As an early member of our SE org and regional team, you'll be instrumental in helping define our sales-assisted motions.
* Join a fantastic team at a magical time: Notion has over three million users with a small team, which gives us a huge green field to work with. You'll join at the perfect time to shape how we grow from here.
* Represent Notion at events: You'll be the face of Notion at industry conferences, trade shows, and customer events. You'll present our product vision and showcase its features, helping to build trust and strong relationships with both prospective and existing customers.
* Elevate your skills as we tackle our most impactful challenges: We've achieved more than teams 10x our size in less time — and there's so much more to do and learn.

**Skills You'll Need To Bring**

* 4+ years as Technical Sales Engineer, Solutions Engineer or Solutions Architect
* You’re able to understand and explain how APIs can be used to support advanced customer workflows
* You have experience working with third-party integrations for IAM/SSO, DLP or SIEM platforms
* You have strong project management experience and have managed complex projects to completion
* You have a growth mindset and thrive in the building stage of a nascent team
* You’re highly adaptable, easily acclimating to a rapidly changing business and industry
* Native level Japanese, business level English both in writing and speaking

**Nice To Haves**

* You've been a first or early hire at a fast-growing startup before
* You have experience using Notion
* You have coding experience that would enable you to write basic scripts using the Notion API
* You have experience using with and designing relational databases

We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
